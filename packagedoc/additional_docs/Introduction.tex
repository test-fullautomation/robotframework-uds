The library \pkg\ provides a set of \textbf{Robot Framework} keywords 
for sending UDS (Unified Diagnostic Services) requests and interpreting 
responses from automotive electronic control units (ECUs).

Whether you're testing diagnostic sessions, reading data, or controlling 
routines on an ECU, the UDS Library simplifies these tasks by offering specific 
keywords like \rcode{DiagnosticSessionControl}, \rcode{ReadDataByIdentifier}, 
and \rcode{RoutineControl}. 

These keywords are designed to handle the complexity of UDS communication, 
enabling you to write efficient and reliable automated tests.

Moreover, you can now refer to UDS services by their readable names rather than 
hexadecimal IDs e.g \rcode{ReadDataByName}, \rcode{RoutineControlByName}
It helps to make your tests more intuitive and easier to maintain.
