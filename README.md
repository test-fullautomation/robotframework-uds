# RobotFramework_UDS Package Description

## Getting Started

The library **RobotFramework_UDS** provides a set of Robot Framework
keywords for sending UDS (UnifiedDiagnostic Services) requests and
interpreting responses from automotive electronic control units (ECUs).

Whether you're testing diagnostic sessions, reading data, or controlling
routines on an ECU, the UDS Library simplifies these tasks by offering
specific keywords for almost any UDS service as defined in [ISO
14229](https://automotive.wiki/index.php/ISO_14229).

These keywords are designed to handle the complexity of UDS
communication, enabling you to write efficient and reliable automated
tests.

## How to install

The **RobotFramework_UDS** can be installed in two different ways.

1.  Installation via PyPi (recommended for users)

    ``` 
    pip install RobotFramework_UDS
    ```

    PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/RobotFramework_UDS/)

2.  Installation via GitHub (recommended for developers)

    -   Clone the **robotframework-uds** repository to your machine.

        ``` 
        git clone https://github.com/test-fullautomation/robotframework-uds.git
        ```

    -   Install dependencies

        **RobotFramework_UDS** requires some additional Python
        libraries. Before you install the cloned repository sources you
        have to install the dependencies manually. The names of all
        related packages you can find in the file `requirements.txt` in
        the repository root folder. Use pip to install them:

        ``` 
        pip install -r ./requirements.txt
        ```

        Additionally install **LaTeX** (recommended: TeX Live). This is
        used to render the documentation.

    -   Configure dependencies

        The installation of **RobotFramework_UDS** includes to generate
        the documentation in PDF format. This is done by an application
        called **GenPackageDoc**, that is part of the installation
        dependencies (see `requirements.txt`).

        **GenPackageDoc** uses **LaTeX** to generate the documentation
        in PDF format. Therefore **GenPackageDoc** needs to know where
        to find **LaTeX**. This is defined in the **GenPackageDoc**
        configuration file

        ``` 
        packagedoc\packagedoc_config.json
        ```

        Before you start the installation you have to introduce the
        following environment variable, that is used in
        `packagedoc_config.json`:

        -   `GENDOC_LATEXPATH` : path to `pdflatex` executable

    -   Use the following command to install **RobotFramework_UDS**:

        ``` 
        setup.py install
        ```
